# Tensorflow2.0-cifar-10-ResNet18
tensorflow2.0 build simple Resnet18 to solve cifar-10

resnet.py is the model
cifar-10 includes load data and train using tensorflow 2.0 API such as tf.keras.Model.compile()/fit()/evaluate()
More specifically https://tensorflow.google.cn/api_docs/python/tf
cifar-10-1 is the same as cifar-10 but not use compile and fit function, just to compare
